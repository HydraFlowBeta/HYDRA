Welcome to Hydra! Follow the steps below to properly connect and use the script:

Connect with the Trial Key
To begin, you need to connect using the provided trial key: TRIAL. This will grant you temporary access to the features.

Wait for Server Authorization
After entering the key, please wait for approximately 10 seconds. This allows the server to authenticate your connection and grant the necessary permissions.

Add Your Desired Settings
Before activating the Auto Spin Magic or Race, make sure to add the desired settings or selections to the script. This is an important step to ensure the script operates according to your preferences.

Activate Your Selection
Once you have added the settings, be sure to activate your selection to confirm the changes. This will prepare the script for the next step.

Activate Auto Spin
Finally, you may activate the Auto Spin feature. Once enabled, the magic will take over, and the script will automatically perform the selected actions.
